At a high level,
What are main technologies/software we need to focus for below requirements,
1.	How to transfer data from fish watch locations. Definitely IOT devices but the requirement says the fish watch might not have mobile signals.
2.	Are we providing cloud-based solution or on-premises applications?
3.	How the data is presented to customer, a reporting tool or an application ?
4.	Technical stock for Front end (i.e, for reporting tool or application), Database type (I think no sql database since we might be receiving data from camera)
5.	What prediction model is best for this problem ?
6.	What will be the cost effective solution ?
7.	Any add-ons or alternative approach

Follow these guidelines to architect a reliable system on the cloud:

Define application programming interfaces (APIs) to structure the coupling between components while creating an abstraction from implementation details.

Deploy a service-oriented architecture to create a product from a collection of services, and deploy microservices architectures to create individual services.

Determine whether operations are synchronous, asynchronous, or batch based on desired simplicity, responsiveness, coupling, reliability, and cost efficiency.

Design how each service will scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate more traffic and data by leveraging additional computational resources.

Leverage frameworks and platforms to more efficiently develop services across the organization while making it easier to adopt best practices.
