At a high level,
What are main technologies/software we need to focus for below requirements,
1.	How to transfer data from fish watch locations. Definitely IOT devices but the requirement says the fish watch might not have mobile signals.
2.	Are we providing cloud-based solution or on-premises applications?
3.	How the data is presented to customer, a reporting tool or an application ?
4.	Technical stock for Front end (i.e, for reporting tool or application), Database type (I think no sql database since we might be receiving data from camera)
5.	What prediction model is best for this problem ?
6.	What will be the cost effective solution ?
7.	Any add-ons or alternative approach
